Next, you may register a resourceful route to the controller:

Route::resource('photos', 'PhotoController');

This single route declaration creates multiple routes to handle a variety of actions on the resource.


Nested Resources
Sometimes you may need to define routes to a nested resource. For example, a photo resource may have multiple comments that may be attached to the photo. 
To nest the resource controllers, use "dot" notation in your route declaration:

Route::resource('photos.comments', 'PhotoCommentController');

This route will register a nested resource that may be accessed with URIs like the following:

/photos/{photo}/comments/{comment}

Shallow Nesting
Often, it is not entirely necessary to have both the parent and the child IDs within a URI since the child ID is already a unique identifier. 
When using unique identifier such as auto-incrementing primary keys to identify your models in URI segments, you may choose to use "shallow nesting":

Route::resource('photos.comments', 'CommentController')->shallow();

If your application is exclusively using controller based routes, you should take advantage of Laravel's route cache. Using the route cache will drastically decrease 
the amount of time it takes to register all of your application's routes. In some cases, your route registration may even be up to 100x faster.
To generate a route cache, just execute the route:cache Artisan command:

php artisan route:cache
